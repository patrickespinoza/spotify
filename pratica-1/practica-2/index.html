<h2 id="Introduction"> 1. introduction</h2>

<p> Please read these Terms of Use <span id="tamaÃ±o"> "Terms"</span> carefully as they 
govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's 
personalized services for streaming music and other content, 
including all of our websites and software applications that 
incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Spotify Service") 
and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that 
is made available through the Spotify Service ("Content")</p>

<p>Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the Spotify Privacy 
Policy and additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, 
all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.</p>

<p>By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, 
you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms,
 then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
</p>
<p>THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, 
AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE 
OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, 
RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, 
OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS 
DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.</p>

 <p>   
These Terms are between you and Spotify USA Inc.,

 <h2 id="spotify"> 2. The spotify Service</h2>

 <p class="negritas">Spotify Service options</p>

 <p>We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify 
    Service options are provided free of charge, while other options 
    require payment before they can be accessed ("Paid Subscriptions"). 
    We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, 
    including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible 
    for the products and services provided by such third parties.</p>

    <p class="negritas">Trials</p>

    <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer 
        trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without 
        payment or at a reduced rate ("Trial"). By using a Spotify 
        Service via a Trial, you agree to the Spotify Paid Subscription
         Terms.</p>
         <p class="negritas">Third-party applications, devices and open source software</p>

            and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices,
             speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications
